Specify:
- type of the target(s)
- range the target must be in (if not touch)
- exact number of targets / size of target
- the effect on the target(s)
- the exact amount and type of damage / amount of healing
- the scope of the effect
- the duration of the effect (if not instantaneous)

Don't specify:
- conditions applied before the effect (saving throws, line of sight, range blocking barriers, ...)
- willingness of target
- visibility of target
- 'of your choice'
- 'of you' in 'within x feet of you'
- non-essential details
- non-essential examples
- secondary consequences of the effect, unless they are an effect on their own (?) (TODO: what about Detect Magic? Maybe only split effects if parameters (duration etc.) differ?)
